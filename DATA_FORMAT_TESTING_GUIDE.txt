FT600 Data Display - Data Format Testing Guide
================================================

Your ft600_display.exe is ready! Since the sine wave isn't displaying correctly,
use these keyboard controls to find the correct data format combination.

CRITICAL TESTING KEYS:
----------------------
E key - Toggle Endianness (Little/Big Endian)
D key - Toggle bit width (12-bit / 16-bit signed)
B key - Toggle 12-bit alignment (High bits 15-4 / Low bits 11-0)

TESTING PROCEDURE:
------------------
1. Run: ft600_display.exe

2. Check data range first (shown on right side as "Data: Min=X Max=Y Avg=Z")
   - If 12-bit: should be roughly -2048 to +2047
   - If 16-bit: could be -32768 to +32767

3. Test these 8 combinations systematically:

   Combination 1: Little-Endian + 12-bit Low bits (11-0)  [DEFAULT]
   Combination 2: Little-Endian + 12-bit High bits (15-4) [Press B]
   Combination 3: Little-Endian + 16-bit signed           [Press D]
   Combination 4: Big-Endian + 12-bit Low bits            [Press E]
   Combination 5: Big-Endian + 12-bit High bits           [Press E+B]
   Combination 6: Big-Endian + 16-bit signed              [Press E+D]
   Combination 7: Try other combinations as needed

4. For each combination, check if waveform looks like a sine wave

DISPLAY CONTROLS:
-----------------
SPACE   - Pause/Resume data capture
F       - Auto-fit Y-axis to current data range
W/S     - Manual Y-axis zoom (in/out)
T       - Cycle trigger mode (OFF/RISING/FALLING/AUTO)
R       - Reset buffer and re-trigger
L/R     - Adjust trigger level (left/right arrows)
UP/DOWN - Adjust sample rate (more/less detail)

PRESETS:
--------
1-4 keys: Sample rate presets (1=all samples, 2=1/10, 3=1/100, 4=1/1000)
5-8 keys: Y-scale presets (5=±4096, 6=±2048, 7=±1024, 8=±512)

DISPLAY INFORMATION:
--------------------
Top Right: Current format settings, speed, data statistics
Bottom: Control instructions
Red Warning: "Data clipped" means Y-scale is too small (press F to auto-fit)

TYPICAL ADC DATA FORMATS:
--------------------------
Most ADCs use one of these:
- 12-bit in LOW bits (11-0): Common for older ADCs
- 12-bit in HIGH bits (15-4): Common for modern ADCs (left-aligned)
- 16-bit signed: Full 16-bit ADCs

EXPECTED SINE WAVE:
-------------------
A proper sine wave should:
- Oscillate smoothly above and below zero line
- Have symmetric positive and negative peaks
- Show smooth curves, not jagged lines (adjust sample rate if needed)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
If waveform still doesn't look correct after trying all combinations:
1. Check FPGA data output format documentation
2. Verify USB data is actually a sine wave (check with oscilloscope/logic analyzer)
3. Check if data has any headers or framing bytes
4. Verify expected data rate matches actual rate

DEFAULT SETTINGS:
-----------------
- Endianness: Little-Endian
- Bit Width: 12-bit signed
- Alignment: Low bits (11-0)
- Y-Scale: ±4096
- Trigger: AUTO mode
- Trigger Level: 0

Once you find the correct combination, note which keys you pressed!
